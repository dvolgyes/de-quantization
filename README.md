The code is implemented in Python3, and requires Python3.6 or newer.


Installation
------------

The code could be installed directly from Github:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/dvolgyes/dequantization
```
(Tested on Ubuntu 18.04.)

The code and the paper about it  are currently under review.

Usage
-----

Aftern installation, the command line options can be queried:
```
dequantization.py -h
```

The code could be used as a library too, but it is tricky.
(You have to load & pre-process the data, set up the algorithm,
save the results, etc.)
